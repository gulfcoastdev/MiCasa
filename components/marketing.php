                <p class="testimonial-text">"I recently spent 99 nights at this wonderful Airbnb with my wife and son, and it was perfect for us. The place was spotless, and we didn't spot a single bug inside or outside - huge plus! The badminton setup was a hit with my son, and we enjoyed many hours playing together. The free laundry facility was super convenient, and the small BBQ grill was a nice touch. Janusz was incredibly responsive and answered all our questions promptly, making our long-term stay feel like a breeze. Overall, it was exactly what we needed while waiting for our house to be built. The location was great, and we'd definitely stay here again. Thanks for a comfortable and hassle-free stay!"</p>
